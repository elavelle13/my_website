			<h2><span class="bold-title">treno</span> <span class="light-title">web design</span></h2>
			<p>IdeaBase was approached by Treno, a high-scale Italian restaurant located in Kent, OH, to create their website. The team behind this project consisted of Graphic Designers, Web Developers, and User Experience Designers. My role within the project switched from task to task. I acted as the User Experience Designer during the initial phase of the project. I conducted a competitive analysis of restaurants around the Cleveland/Akron area. In my report I included general observations of what their competitors were doing, and provided recommendations based on the organization's goals and their audience's needs. As the UX Designer, I assisted with the creation of the organization's sitemap and low fidelity mockups. When it was time to create the high fidelity mockups, I worked closely with the Graphic Designers to ensure the low fidelity mockups made sense and transitioned into the organization's established brand</p>
			<p>My role as the UX Designer within the project switched once we began the development phase of the project. I helped assist the Web Developers with building out the styles, functionalities, and structure of the website. The Developers and I worked through a respiratory on GitHub so that we could collaborate simultaneously.</p>
			<p>As the development phase starts to finalize, I will switch back to my initial role as the UX Designer to conduct the usability tests. I will work with other team members when developing the usability test script to ensure all areas are covered. Once the script is finalized, we will conduct the usability tests in our UX Lab. During our usability test sessions, we will gather eye-tracking information, notes, and videos to observe and analyze for our report back to the client.</p>

			<p>If you would like to see the entire process of this project, please feel free to contact me. I would be more than glad to share my wireframes, code samples, and reports.</p>
