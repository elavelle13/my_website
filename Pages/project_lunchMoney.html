			<h2><span class="bold-title">Lunch Money Buddy</span> <span class="light-title">mobile application</span></h2>
			<p>Lunch Money Buddy is a mobile application that allows parents and guardians of school age children to manage various aspects of their kids' in-school cafeteria lunch accounts. For this project, I was expected to create a user interface that was appealing and functional to the users.</p> 
			<p>The biggest challenge when creating this user interface was coming up with a design that reflected common mobile UI practices, but was also simple enough to use. The user personas for this mobile application ranged from users with moderate experience with smartphones to users with little to no experience. This in itself made the initial design process difficult and time consuming.</p>
			<p>To overcome this challenge, I conducted my own research on popular mobile applications to see the common trends happening today. When conducting my research, I focused on two mobile applications: Twitter and Facebook. I chose to focus on these two applications based on the notion that they were widely used by a wide range of age groups, and were constantly updating their mobile applications with the latest UI trends. I found that both mobile applications, along with a few others, shared similar navigational structures and color schemes. When finding this comparison, I looked at other mobile applications, such as Instagram and Duolingo, and found that these applications shared similar UI designs as well.Discovering this, I went to the drawing board to start figuring out the structure of my mobile application. I created a sitemap and various drawings to showcase the user's journey. From there I started to develop my low fidelity wireframes that I later shared with my fellow classmates to get feedback and bounce some ideas around. Talking and sharing ideas with my colleagues helped me overcome some road blocks I encountered when trying to determine what should and shouldn't be included in the application.</p>
			<p>The results of my work are very different from my initial designs in the first phase of this project. My final prototype has more detailed features and functionalities that my initial design lacked. The sign up task is a good example of this. In my first designs, this was a major project specification that I did not put much time and effort into. Doing so did not effectively portray the user's journey. In my final prototype though, I was able to create a structure that flows through the sign up process easily and effectively.</p>
			<p>Looking back on my process throughout this entire project, there are some things I've learned that I will take into consideration when designing another user interface. In most projects, I usually only have iOS users in mind. Moving forward, I need to start thinking about design for all different platforms, especially mobile. Doing so will help my research and design skills improve by allowing me to not always take a linear approach. Another major setback I encountered within this project was relaying my thought process to others. There's been improvements from my last project and this one, but there were still times during this process where what I was drawing/designing was not being fully understood by my other colleagues. </p>
